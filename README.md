# Project-data-driven-methods

The file "classification.m" is a matlab file that is able to recognize/classify images belonging to certain categories,
coming from a test and training file full of images.
The test images are in jpg or in png format.
I have included a few test images in the github project already, but to further test the code, the user can download images
in the same format from google and try himself to see if the code is able to recognize also other images, different from the ones I used.
Be careful to have the matlab code in the same folder of the other files of the project.
