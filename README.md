# Project-data-driven-methods

The file "classification.m" is a matlab file that is able to recognize/classify images belonging to certain categories,
coming from a test and training file full of images, which can be downloaded from this link: https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02
The file is called caltech-101.zip. Once it's been downloaded, you must click on calteck-101, then extract the file called 101-ObjectCategories.tar.gz.
It may be better to create a new folder in the desktop to put the extracted file with the object categories, together with the matlab code.
The test images are in jpg or in png format.
I have included a few test images in the github project already, but to further test the code, the user can download images
in the same format from google and try himself to see if the code is able to recognize also other images, different from the ones I used.
Be careful to have the matlab code in the same folder of the other files of the project.
